# Qmanoid Amiga
QMANOID is a little game for the Amiga 500.

The game is written in plain and simple C and uses the OS for all graphics and i/o operations.  

I wrote this to learn C programming on the Amiga, 
and also to demonstrate that the AmigaOS is practically a very capable game engine.

VBCC is used as compiler.
